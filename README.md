# Things We Wanted to Include / Began to Include
- Transform/Crop - Alejandro began implementing this but never finished
- Drawing - I (Kyle) began implementing this but realized that I wouldn't have enough time to finish it
    - In the code, there's buttons for a brush tool
    - The image is also drawn on top of a canvas so that we can implement the draw tool
- Undo/Redo - We weren't really sure how to implement this so we put it to the side until it was too late
